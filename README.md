# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This was created by Emmanuel Sibanda as part of the Vial coding challenge

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

I wrote about 10 tests to assess whether the calculator correctly outputs calculations in the PEMDAS order and if the additional buttons I created work as intended. I hope these tests also help you better evaluate my calculator. 

Running `npm test` will run these tests


### Additional Notes
You will need to press the "=" sign before any computation is carried out, with the exception of exponentials and percentage.
